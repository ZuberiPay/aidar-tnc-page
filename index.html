        <strong>1. Welcome to Aider</strong><br /><br />1.1 Aider operates a
        platform that allows:<br /><br />(a) users to advertise items for rent
        (such users being &quot;owners&quot;);<br /><br />(b) owners to
        communicate with and enter into agreements with other users to rent
        (such users that rent being &quot;renters&quot;);<br /><br />(c) renters
        to pay owners for renting the relevant items; and<br /><br />(e) users
        to resolve disputes concerning the hired items,which we make available
        to you through the Aider application available for download on your
        mobile device (the &quot;Aider App&quot;) and our website at
        <a href="https://aiderapp.com"> https://aiderapp.com </a> (together, the
        &quot;Aider Service&quot;).<br /><br />1.2 The Aider Service is provided
        by Aider Ltd (&quot;Aider&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or
        &quot;us&quot;).<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >2. Important warnings about lending and hiring items</strong
        ><br /><br />2.1 Aider only provides a platform that enables users to
        rent and lend items, but does not rent or lend items itself. We also do
        not regularly monitor the quality of the items made available for hire
        by owners through the Aider Service.<br /><br />2.2 As such, the owner
        (and not us) is responsible for ensuring that items conform to any
        descriptions provided, are fit for purpose and safe to use. If you are a
        renter, we will not be responsible to you for any items that you hire
        through the Aider Service.<br /><br />2.3 If you are a owner, you will
        also be responsible for complying with any obligations you may have
        under applicable law with respect to the items that you provide for
        hire, including giving effect to renters&apos; rights under applicable
        consumer law and compensating any damage to the renter or any other
        person caused by your items.<br /><br />2.4 If you are a renter, you
        will be responsible for the proper care and return of any items you hire
        through the Aider Service. You will not normally be held liable for
        compensating the owner for accidental loss or damage to those items
        unless loss or damage is the result of negligence, forgetfulness,
        carelessness, improper use, not having the appropriate skills or
        experience to operate those items, and theft. The Aider Service will
        determine if you are liable under these circumstances. You will be
        responsible for any damage you cause to other people or property when
        you use those items.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >3. Your relationship with us</strong
        ><br /><br />3.1 This document and any documents referred to within it

          >9. Owner Specific Terms</strong
        ><br /><br />9.1 This paragraph 9 applies to you if you are an owner.<br /><br />9.2
        You must not offer to lend through the Aider Service any firearms,
        weapons, pornography, mature content, animals or any items that it would
        be illegal to offer for hire in your or the renter&apos;s country of
        residence. We may remove any items offered for hire from the Aider
        Service if we believe such items are illegal, immoral or damaging to our
        reputation.<br /><br />9.3 You are responsible for ensuring that:<br />(a)
        you have all necessary rights to hire out any items you advertise on the
        Aider Service, and that the renter&apos;s use of those items will not
        infringe any other party&apos;s rights;<br /><br />(b) you deliver any
        hired items to the renter in accordance with the agreement you reach
        with the renter;<br /><br />(c) any descriptions of the items you
        advertise for hire through the Aider Service are accurate and include
        all information relevant to the use of the item, including (as
        appropriate): (i) notice of any defects, restrictions or other
        requirements that may apply to the use of the item; and (ii) any
        instructions or notices that may reasonably be required to use the item
        safely;<br /><br />(d) the items you advertise on the Aider Service: (i)
        conform in all material respects to any pictures or descriptions that
        you upload to the Aider Service; (ii) are safe to use in accordance with
        any reasonable instructions that you provide to the renter; (iii) are
        fit for any purpose for which such items would normally be used, or any
        purpose communicated to you by the renter; (iv) can be legally offered
        for hire.<br /><br />(e) any rental item is only handed over to the
        renter after the transaction(s) are approved by the Aider Verification
        process. You must only handover the item to the person verified by
        Aider, not third parties.<br /><br />9.4 If you offer storage space for
        hire, you must also ensure that the space is accessible safely and
        legally, that it is secure and free from leaks and/or excessive heat or
        cold. You will be responsible for any damage to any of the buyer&apos;s
        items that are left in your storage area.<br /><br />9.5 You will be
        responsible for any damage the renter or any other person may suffer as
        a result of any defect in the item they have borrowed from you, or for
        any failure to comply with the requirements in paragraph 9.2.<br /><br />9.6
        You are free to agree any other terms on which you hire an item to a
        renter, including the price you wish to charge to the renter for hiring
        your item for the relevant hire period (the &quot;Hire Fee&quot;). When
        you post items for hire on the Aider Service, you must ensure that the
        Hire Fee you advertise on your listing is the total price payable for
        hiring your items, including any applicable taxes or costs of
        delivery.<br /><br />9.7 Once you agree to the terms on which you will
        lend an item to a renter, you must not try to amend those terms
        (including the price) unless you have a valid, justifiable reason for
        doing so and the renter agrees to those amended terms.<br /><br />9.8
        You can remove a listing or cancel your agreement to lend an item to a
        renter at any time up to 48 hours before the start of the relevant hire
        period. If you cancel an agreement to hire an item to a renter less than
        48 hours before the start of the hire period, we may charge you a
        cancellation fee equal to 30% of the relevant Hire Fee.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >10. Renter Specific Terms</strong
        ><br /><br />10.1 This paragraph 10 applies to you if you are a
        renter.<br /><br />10.2 When you agree to hire an item with an owner,
        the owner grants you a limited right to use that item for the relevant
        hire period. This right is personal to you and you are not allowed to
        give this right to any other person.<br /><br />10.3 You are responsible
        for ensuring that:<br /><br />(a) you are legally allowed to use any
        item that you borrow through the Aider Service;<br /><br />(b) you
        comply with all applicable law when using the item;<br /><br />(c) you
        comply with any reasonable directions provided by the owner in order to
        use the item safely;<br /><br />(d) you return the item in the same
        condition as it was in when you collected it from the owner (any
        reasonable wear and tear excepted).<br /><br />10.4 If you hire a
        storage space through the Aider Service, you must ensure that the items
        you store are not flammable, dangerous or hazardous to people or
        animals. You will be responsible for any damage caused to the storage
        space, the owner or any other person or property as a result of your use
        of any storage space you hire through the Aider Service.<br /><br />10.5
        You are free to agree with the owner how you will return any items you
        have hired to the owner; however, you must ensure that you return any
        items you have hired to the owner before your hire period ends.<br /><br />10.6
        You will be responsible for any loss of or damage to the item you have
        hired as a result of negligence, carelessness, improper use, not having
        the appropriate skills or experience to operate those items, and theft.
        The Aider Service will determine if you are liable under these
        circumstances. Please see paragraph 15 for more information about how we
        handle disputes between renters and owners, including any if the item is
        damaged, lost or stolen.<br />10.7 You can cancel a request to borrow an
        item at any time before the request is accepted by the owner, or at any
        time up to 48 hours after the request is submitted, known as the
        &lsquo;cooling off period&rsquo;. There is no cooling off period if the
        request is within 48 hours of the start date. If you cancel before the
        request has been accepted, or within the cooling off period you will
        receive a full refund.<br /><br />10.8 If you fail to return an item by
        the agreed deadline you must contact the owner and or Aider to notify
        them as soon as you are aware you are going to miss the deadline. You
        will also need to book and pay for the extended time immediately. The
        owner may not be able to accommodate the extension in which case it is
        your responsibility to get the item(s) back to the owner within a
        timeframe that suits the owner. If you do not do so you will be liable
        to pay late fees(&ldquo;Late Fees&rdquo;) as determined to be
        appropriate by Aider. You agree that Aider can charge this amount from
        your card or bank account without further permission.<br /><br />10.9 If
        you miss the agreed deadline for return and are uncommunicative with the
        owner or Aider, or we have reason to believe you have caused damage to
        the item, you agree that Aider can take a holding deposit from your
        account up to the full value of the items you have rented
        (&ldquo;Holding Deposit&rdquo;). This deposit will be fully refundable,
        less any fees owed to the company or owner, once the items are returned,
        replaced or repaired. Otherwise the deposit will not be refunded.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >11. Fees and payment</strong
        ><br /><br />11.1 If you are an owner, we will collect the Hire Fee from
        the renter on your behalf. Unless we are unable to obtain payment from
        the renter, such as where a buyer&apos;s payment method is refused or
        our payment services provider determines that there is a risk of fraud,
        we will transfer you the Hire Fee within 23 hours of the start date of
        the rental. We will also charge you a fee of 24% of the Hire Fee
        (&quot;owner Fee&quot;), which we will deduct from the amount we
        transfer to you.<br /><br />11.2 If you are a renter, once you have
        agreed to hire an item from the owner, we will charge you the full Hire
        Fee on the owner&apos;s behalf. In addition to the Hire Fee, we will
        also charge you an additional fee for your use of the Aider Service
        equal to 24% of the price you pay to the owner to hire an item
        (&quot;Renter Fee&quot;).<br /><br />11.3 If we are unsuccessful in
        charging the Hire Fee, Renter Fee, Late Fee, Settlement Fee or any other
        amount to your credit or debit card, and have still not received payment
        within 7 days after informing you, we may suspend or temporarily disable
        all or part of your access to the Aider Service (without any
        responsibility to you), and we shall be under no obligation to provide
        any or all of the Aider Service while the amount concerned is unpaid.
        This does not affect any other rights and remedies available to us or
        the owner. If you chargeback a payment you were obliged to pay by the
        terms of this agreement, your account will be immediately suspended
        until the payment is re-paid, or the chargeback is cancelled.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >12. Your content</strong
        ><br /><br />12.1 You confirm that any images, text or information that
        you upload to the Aider Service, including any reviews that you post
        about other users or items (collectively, your &quot;User Content&quot;)
        will meet the Rules of Acceptable Use.<br /><br />12.2 We do not claim
        ownership of your User Content, and ownership will remain with you and
        any third party whose content you include in your User Content. Instead,
        you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual

        the User Content anywhere and in any form for the purposes of providing
        the Aider Service (including allowing users that you give access to any
        User Content to view and use your User Content).<br /><br />12.3 You
        must ensure that you are able to grant us the above licence for any
        content owned by a third party that you include in your User Content.<br /><br />12.4
        Our right to use your User Content does not in any way affect your
        privacy rights. Please see our Privacy Policy

        liable for double the fees avoided, or a ₦500,000 fine (whichever is
        more) for each instance of doing so.<br /><br />13.3 Failure to comply
        with the Rules of Acceptable Use constitutes a serious breach of these
        Terms and Conditions, and may result in our taking all or any of the
        following actions (with or without notice):<br /><br />(a) immediate,

        enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary.<br /><br />13.4
        The responses described in paragraph 13.3 are not limited, and we may
        take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >14. Notice and takedown policy</strong
        ><br /><br />14.1 Any person may contact us by sending us a notice (an
        &quot;Infringement Notice&quot;) if any content available through the
        Aider Service infringes their rights. The Infringement Notice should be
        sent by email to copyright@aider.com. Please provide the following
        information in the Infringement Notice:<br /><br />(a) your name and
        contact details;<br /><br />(b) a statement explaining in sufficient
        detail why you consider that the content available through the Aider
        Service infringes your rights or fails to comply with our Rules of

        identifying the problematic content.<br /><br />14.2 We will take the
        action that we believe is appropriate depending on the nature of the
        Infringement Notice and will aim to respond to you within a reasonable
        period of time on the action we propose to take.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >15. Resolving disputes between renters and owners</strong
        ><br /><br />15.1 We encourage users to resolve any disputes directly.
        If, as a renter, you have lost or damaged an item, you are responsible
        for reimbursing the owner immediately for the full value of repairing
        the item (if possible) or replacing it.<br /><br />15.2 If you are an
        owner, we may ask you to provide proof of purchase, photos of any damage
        caused to an item, or any other evidence to support your claim for
        reimbursement from a renter. Where you claim that a renter has damaged
        an item, we may also ask you to provide photos of your item taken before
        it was provided to a renter, to support your claim that any damage was
        caused by the renter (and was not present at the start of the hire
        period).<br /><br />15.3 In the event that a renter and an owner are
        unable to resolve a dispute between them directly, they can ask us to
        mediate the dispute. If we do mediate a dispute, we may charge a fee of
        up to 30% of any amounts that we, the owner and the renter determine are
        payable by the renter to compensate the owner for any loss or damage to
        the item. We will charge this amount to the renter in addition to any
        amounts the renter is required to pay to the owner (together known as
        the &ldquo;Settlement Fee&rdquo;). If Aider mediates the dispute you
        agree to accept Aider&rsquo;s conclusion and pay any amount which Aider
        determines you are liable for.<br /><br />15.4 If you owe Aider or
        another user money through the terms of these Terms of Service you agree
        to pay the sum promptly and not more than 48 hours from it being
        requested. In the event that you do not pay the owed money within this
        timeframe, Aider will debit this amount from your card. In agreeing to
        these Terms you agree to allow us to do so and waive your right to
        chargeback this transaction with your bank.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >16. Ending our relationship</strong
        ><br /><br />16.1 If at any time you do not feel that you can agree to
        these Terms and Conditions or any changes made to these Terms and
        Conditions or the Aider Service, you must immediately stop using the
        Aider Service.<br /><br />16.2 Deleting the Aider App might not close
        any Account you have created in relation to the Aider Service. You must
        notify us if you wish to close your Account by contacting us using the
        details and functionality at https://aiderapp.com/contact-us, and we
        will end your use of the Aider Service.<br /><br />16.3 We may
        immediately end your use of the Aider Service if you break the Rules of
        Acceptable Use, any other important rule(s), or terms and conditions we
        set for accessing and using the Aider Service including these Terms and
        Conditions.<br /><br />16.4 We may also withdraw any part of the Aider
        Service at any time and will notify you if we feel it will significantly
        affect your usage of the Aider Service.<br /><br />16.5 If you or we end
        your use of the Aider Service or we withdraw Aider Service as described
        in this section, we may delete your User Content, any other information
        that you have uploaded to the Aider Service or any other information we
        hold about you. You will also lose any rights you have to use the Aider
        Service or to access our content or your User Content. You should
        therefore ensure that you keep a copy of any information or content you
        use on the Aider Service, as well as your User Content, as we will not
        offer you compensation for any losses you might suffer if you lose your
        rights to access and use the Aider Service or any such information,
        content or User Content.<br /><br />16.6 The termination of your use of
        the Aider Service and the cancellation of your Account shall not affect
        any of your obligations to pay any sums due to us.<br /><br />16.7
        Nothing in this paragraph 16 affects any legal rights you may have under
        the law of the country in which you are resident.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >17. Our liability/responsibility to you</strong
        ><br /><br />17.1 While we will do our best to ensure that the Aider App
        itself is of a reasonable standard and quality and matches any
        descriptions we have provided you, the Aider App and any other portion
        of the Aider Service may contain some content owned or developed by
        third parties. As we do not own or produce such third party content, we
        cannot be responsible for it in any way.<br /><br />17.2 In addition,
        due to the nature of the Internet and technology, the Aider Service is
        unfortunately provided on an &quot;as available&quot; and &quot;as
        is&quot; basis. This means that we are unable to promise that your use
        of the Aider Service will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free
        or meet your expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to
        the performance or availability of the Aider Service in these Terms and
        Conditions and, to the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any
        commitments that may be implied by law.<br /><br />17.3 In the event of
        a claim arising out of the provision of the Aider Service, our
        responsibility to you will never be more than the amount you have paid
        us in the 12 months prior to the claim arising and, in the event that
        you have not paid us any money, we shall have no responsibility
        whatsoever to you.<br /><br />17.4 In every case, we will never be
        responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably
        foreseeable.<br /><br />17.5 The above does not affect your rights under
        the applicable law of the country in which you are resident, including
        our responsibility to you for any personal injury or death caused by our
        negligence.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >18. Resolving disputes with us</strong
        ><br /><br />18.1 If you have a dispute with us relating to the Aider
        Service, in the first instance please contact us at info@aider.com and
        attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.<br /><br />18.2 In
        the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute
        informally, we will discuss and agree with you the most effective way of
        resolving our dispute.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >19. Changes to the Aider Service</strong
        ><br /><br />19.1 We are constantly updating and improving the Aider
        Service to try and find ways to provide you with new and innovative
        features and services. Improvements and updates are also made to reflect
        changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and the way people use the
        Internet and the Aider Service.<br /><br />19.2 In order to do this, we
        may need to update, reset, stop offering and/or supporting a particular
        part of the Aider Service, or feature relating to the Aider Service
        (&quot;changes to the Aider Service&quot;). These changes to the Aider
        Service may affect your past activities on the Aider Service, features
        that you use, your User Content and any other information you submit to
        the Aider Service (&quot;Service Elements&quot;). Any changes to the
        Aider Service could involve your Service Elements being deleted or
        reset.<br /><br />19.3 You agree that a key characteristic of the Aider
        Service is that changes to the Aider Service will take place over time
        and this is an important basis on which we grant you access to the Aider
        Service. Once we have made changes to any part of the Aider Service,
        your continued use of the Aider Service will show that you have accepted
        any changes to the Aider Service. You are always free to stop using the
        Aider Service.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >20. Apple App Store Provisions</strong

        downloaded from the Apple App Store. You acknowledge and agree that
        these Terms and Conditions are solely between you and Aider, not Apple,

        the App Store Terms of Service.<br /><br />20.2 You acknowledge that
        Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and
        support services with respect to the Aider App. In the event of any
        failure of the Aider App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may
        notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Aider App
        to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will
        have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Aider
        App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or

        solely governed by these Terms and Conditions and any law applicable to
        Aider as provider of the Aider App.<br /><br />20.3 You acknowledge that
        Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third
        party relating to the Aider App or your possession and/or use of the

        (ii) any claim that the Aider App fails to conform to any applicable
        legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
        protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed
        solely by these Terms and Conditions and any law applicable to Aider as
        provider of the software.<br /><br />20.4 You acknowledge that, in the
        event of any third party claim that the Aider App or your possession and
        use of that Aider App infringes that third party&rsquo;s intellectual
        property rights, Aider, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
        investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any such
        intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these
        Terms and Conditions.<br /><br />20.5 You represent and warrant that (i)
        you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government
        embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a
        &quot;terrorist supporting&quot; country; and (ii) you are not listed on
        any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.<br /><br />20.6
        You and Aider acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple&rsquo;s
        subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and
        Conditions as relates to your licence of the Aider App, and that, upon
        your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms and
        Conditions, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have
        accepted the right) to enforce these Terms and Conditions as relates to
        your licence of the Aider App against you as a third-party beneficiary
        thereof.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >21. Other App Marketplaces and Platforms</strong
        ><br /><br />21.1 This paragraph 21 applies where the Aider App has been
        downloaded from any app store or distribution platform other than the
        Apple App Store, including the Google Play Store (the &quot;Distribution
        Platform &quot;):<br /><br />(a) you acknowledge that these Terms and
        Conditions are between you and Aider, and not with the provider of the
        Distribution Platform (&quot;Store Provider&quot;);<br /><br />(b) your
        use of the Aider App must comply with the Store Provider&rsquo;s
        then-current Distribution Platform Terms of Service;<br /><br />(c) the
        Store Provider is only a provider of the Distribution Platform where you
        obtained the Aider App;<br /><br />(d) Aider, and not the Store
        Provider, is solely responsible for the Aider App;<br /><br />(e) the
        Store Provider has no obligation or liability to you with respect to the
        Aider App or these Terms and Conditions; and<br /><br />(f) you
        acknowledge and agree that the Store Provider is a third-party
        beneficiary to these Terms and Conditions as it relates to the Aider
        App.<br /><br /><br /><strong>22. Changes to the documents</strong
        ><br /><br />22.1 We may revise these Terms and Conditions from time to
        time but the most current version will always be at
        https://aiderapp.com/terms-of-service or in the relevant section of the
        Aider App.<br /><br />22.2 Changes will usually occur because of new
        features being added to the Aider Service, changes in the law or where
        we need to clarify our position on something.<br /><br />22.3 Normally,
        we will try to give you some warning before the new terms become
        effective. However, sometimes changes will need to be made immediately
        and if this happens we will not give you any notice.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >23. Documents that apply to our relationship with you</strong
        ><br /><br />23.1 The current version of these Terms and Conditions
        contains the only terms and conditions that apply to our relationship
        with you.<br /><br />23.2 We intend to rely on these Terms and
        Conditions as setting out the written terms of our agreement with you
        for the provision of the Aider Service. If part of these Terms and
        Conditions cannot be enforced then the remainder of these Terms and
        Conditions will still apply to our relationship.<br /><br />23.3 If you
        do not comply with these Terms and Conditions and we do not take action
        immediately, this does not mean we have given up any right we have and
        we may still take action in the future.<br /><br /><br /><strong
          >24. Law</strong
        ><br /><br />24.1 English law will apply to all disputes and the
        interpretation of these Terms and Conditions. If we need to apply to
